# Iteration 3

### Process and Progression 

The details of this iteration's process follow the progression of the third iteration. 


It is necessary to further explore the secondary website failure in more depth.

#### Secondary Website Failure Discussion 
The goal of the third iteration was building a [new website](https://ccalweb2.netlify.app)
handles the CSS and Javascript better. This was done for time saving purposes, as writing code from scratch with no additional tools to handle some of the code automatically can be extremely time consuming. It is a valid argument that this difficulty is not nececssary when such tools exist. 

The failure of this secondary website seems to have occured as a result of documentation limitations and user error on my end. I was using Hugo as the template to build the website, and this includes referring to the documentation of Hugo itself and the documentation of congo, the Hugo template I was using. I was struggling to find the exact place where information was in general while referencing two different sources, and specifically on linking the menu. I also referred to the example site given with the template to ensure the variables were properly formatted with the correct values. Since these attempts were unsuccessful and the existing documentation, while not straightforward on this, was otherwise well-organized and communicated well, I suspect this is ultimately user error on my end and I am missing something. Despite my prior experience with this tool and programming in general, I recognize the difficulty of programming and that I still struggle with it at times. Problem-solving is a constant fact in programming. The experience of struggling with setting up this secondary website was the major frustration with this iteration. 

Ultimately due to time constraints, I decided to move on from the website at this time to focus on the original website and annotated bibliography.
