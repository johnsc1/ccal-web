# Iteration 3

### Process and Progression 

Following the second iteration and dissatisfaction with the progression of the project, I 
refocused on the original capta - the CCAL (Community Code Archival Librarianship) methods discussion from *We Go Together* and adding this capta to the basic HTML/CSS website. 
This was a pivot from attempting to complete all of the annotated bibliography, which was 
setback time-wise due to difficulties with time management. Reflecting on the state of the 
project at the conclusion of the second iteration and wanting to make more progress in this 
third iteration, I decided it was more in line with this iteration structure to make 
incomplete but clear progress with both the *We Go Together* capta and the annotated bibliography. Incomplete in the sense that one would not be complete before the other, and 
the goal was simply to make progress in any sense. This process is better suited for this project because it honors how one cannot exist without the other - the website cannot be grounded with the annotated bibliography, and the annotated bibliography does not have an application with the tutorial capta website. Both can change as a result of the other. Therefore, this process change was necessary. 

Another major piece of the process for this third iteration was an attempt to change the tool I was using to build the website. The original website was a basic website in HTML and CSS without other additional tools. While this approach gives sigificant flexibility in design since it is very customizable, this process without tools to handle anything becomes incredibly time consuming. In an attempt to better address time limitations, I attempted to build a new website which would handle the Javascript and CSS better by using a Hugo template and releasing the website automatically with each push to Github with Netlify. I have prior experience with this process from building my personal website, and thought that prior knowledge would be helpful here. I also intended to use the menu formatting to easily abstract th annotated bibliography and tutorial from the main homepage, rather than having them on one page so that the user is not overwhelmed viewing the site, and the focus is not each specific capta of that page. 

While it was satisfying to release the blank website through Netlify and I was looking forward to having a website with a quick to build proper menu instead of a static page, I encoutered extensive difficulties in making the menu actually link to the new pages and show the content of them. This is further discussed in the following subsection, and the conclusion of these setbacks was to move forward with the original website. 

After the secondary website failure, I decided to focus fpr the remainder of the iteration on polishing the original website and working on he annotated bibliography. 


Next, it is necessary return to the discussion of the secondary website and to further explore this failure in more depth.

#### Secondary Website Failure Discussion 
The goal of the third iteration was building a [new website](https://ccalweb2.netlify.app)
handles the CSS and Javascript better. This was done for time saving purposes, as writing code from scratch with no additional tools to handle some of the code automatically can be extremely time consuming. It is a valid argument that this difficulty is not nececssary when such tools exist. 

The failure of this secondary website seems to have occured as a result of documentation limitations and user error on my end. I was using Hugo as the template to build the website, and this includes referring to the documentation of Hugo itself and the documentation of congo, the Hugo template I was using. I was struggling to find the exact place where information was in general while referencing two different sources, and specifically on linking the menu. I also referred to the example site given with the template to ensure the variables were properly formatted with the correct values. Since these attempts were unsuccessful and the existing documentation, while not straightforward on this, was otherwise well-organized and communicated well, I suspect this is ultimately user error on my end and I am missing something. Despite my prior experience with this tool and programming in general, I recognize the difficulty of programming and that I still struggle with it at times. Problem-solving is a constant fact in programming. The experience of struggling with setting up this secondary website was the major frustration with this iteration. 

Ultimately due to time constraints, I decided to move on from the website at this time to focus on the original website and annotated bibliography.
