      <h1>Github as a Library</h1>
      <h3>Shell Library of Repositories</h3>
      In Github, each project is held within a repository. Github as a whole can be considered a shell library, where each repository is within but unattached to the whole library. 
      Each project operates as its own entity.
      <h3>Collections in Repositories</h3> 
      Within each repository is a file structure, which represent their collections. A collection is represented by a folder, which might include code files or documentation. 
      The natural order is determined by the users and recorded automatically by the Git and Github system. 
    </div>
    <div class="intro">
      <h1>Understanding the Repository</h1>
        The structure of the repository given by Github presents a rational approach to organization of infromation, organized 
        by tabs. We will explore the repository through each tab. 
    </div>
    <div class="tab">
      <h2>Code Tab</h2>
      The Code Tab is located on the front page of the repository.
      <h3>Commits</h3>
      <img class="clone_img" src="img/clone.png" alt="The green button shows a link to use to clone a Github repository">
      Above the file structure are the commits for the repository. These represent when information is checked in or out of the repository. 
      Commits one of the methods Github uses to record the versions of the information within. 

      The check out process begins with cloning the repository onto your computer via your terminal. A terminal is a method of communicating with your computer system by typing 
      phrases, called commands. Think of cloning as a way to download the repository, which appears as a folder with files inside. 
      The command to clone a repository is 

      <p>git clone repository_link</p>

      Then, your version of the reposutory can be updated with command
      <p>git pull</p>

      There are two methods for accessioning information or aquiring new versions of items. One of these is via commits, which is done with commands in this order.

      <p>
        git add -A
      </p>
      <p>
        git commit -m "your commit message"
      </p>
      <p>
        git push
      </p>

      When items or new versions of items are checked in, they are mirrored in the online collection in Github as they have been placed in the folders on the user's computer. Now, 
      users can check out the most updated version of the repository. Other methods of aquisition will be covered later.
      
      <img src="img/commit.png" alt="Display in the Code tab of the most recent commit message and total number of commits.">

      <h3>Branches</h3>
        When a repository is being used according to the best practices in software which value discrete levels of organization, 
        branches are used. Like within library systems, information circulates between branches and some branches might contain 
        information others do not. Additionally, the main branch is considered the one with the most information and resources. 
        This is the same with branches on Github. Contributors can create branches, check in new information, and request tthat 
        information to be shared into the main branch.

      <h3>README</h3>

      <img src="img/readme.png" alt="Image of an example readme, with a title, overview, and links to resources.">

      Consider the README as a psuedo-finding aid or carrying out the actions of a reference librarian. The README, located below the collections, holds essential information about the project and repository, and directs users toward important 
      information such as details about the project, how to begin using the software, and how to contribute in the free open source software (FOSS) community. 

      The structure of READMEs varies by project, but they tend to share this same purpose. Other READMEs which deviate from this might hold a collection of information on a specific 
      topic within the README itself. This is an example of how Github is flexible to the intentions of users of the platform. 
      <h3>Releases and Packages</h3>
      <img src="img/releases.png" alt="About section with Releases section underneath">
        Releases and packages are a more formal method of recording the version of information. When a release of a document is made 
        or a package of software is released. Every release is preserved as new ones come out, and can still be accessed as 
        new versions are made. Because Github software tends to revolve around the work of FOSS communities, each release of 
        software is the version of a cultural record of these communities.
    </div>
    <div class="tab">
      <h2>Issues Tab</h2>
        Issues are a major point of communication for free open source software development communities. Github as a platform creates 
        organization for issues, keeps record of all issues created and their order of creation by assigning ID numbers to each. This 
        allows users and contributors to continue accessing this information as they work with the project. 
      <h3>Open Issues</h3>
        <img src="img/open_issues.png" alt="List of open issues in a Github repository in the Issues tab">
        Open issues are currently active. When they are open, users and contributors can leave comments. This helps multiple 
        individuals collaborate on one task. Contributors might seek advice from maintainers, or managers, of the project. 
        Users who recognize a problem, or bug, with the code can create issues. Sometimes issues are created to note opportunities 
        for improvement in the project. 
      <h3>Closed Issues</h3>
      <img src="img/closed_issue.png" alt="List of closed issues in a Github repository in the Issues tab">
        Closed issues are issues which have either been resolved or have gone stale (like old bread), or inactive for an extended period of time. 
        All issues are kept as closed issues once they are closed. Sometimes they are closed by maintainers because the issue has been addressed
        adequetley. Issues are most often closed due to a pull request which adds or removes information from the collections, resolving 
        the issue. These will be addressed in the following section.
    </div>
    <div class="tab">
      <h2>Pull Requests Tab</h2>
        Pull requests are another way of accessioning or aquiring new information to the repository and collections. They take a piece of the project 
        which has been continuously modified seperate from the main branch and add this set of modifications to the main branch. A pull request contains 
        commits, which are collected within a branch or fork. 

        In order for the information in these comits to be added to the main branch, maintainers of 
        the repository must accept the pull request and facilitate the merging of commits 
        into the main branch.
      

      <h3>Open Pull Requests</h3>
      <img src="img/open_pr.png" alt="An open pull request to add README writing.">
        A pull request is considered open when it has not been merge and is currently active. In an open pull request, 
        like with issues, the contributor can request a review of the pull request from the maintainers of the 
        repository. Then, if maintainers respond, they evaluate the information in the commits and use 
        the comments to communicate any necessary changes or merge approvals to the contributors. If changes are 
        requested, approval to merge into the main branch is contingent on those changes being made. 

        It is at this stage where the information to be accessioned or aquired is selected by the maintainers, 
        from what the contributors have provided. The contribution of this information and maintainers 
        reviewing this shows their service to the project itself and the project development community.
        
        Additionally, each pull request has it's own unique ID number for reference in that repository. 

      <h3>Closed Pull Requests</h3>
      <img src="img/closed_pr_list.png" alt="List of closed issues in the Github repository in the Pull Requests tab. One has been closed by merging and another closed without merge.">
        A closed pull request may have gone inactive, been closed without a merge, or merged into the main branch. Github itself 
        is structured to preserve these pull requests beyond their active state. These pull requests retain their unique ID, 
        and the full pull request including any discussion on it is preserved as a whole. The red icon with two disconnected pieces refers to a pull request closed without merging, 
        while a purple icon with connected pieces refers to a merged pull request closed by merging.

        Closed pull requests are valuable to the repository as they hold information which might be of use in future project developement, and 
        record the history of the communications and work in the community associated with the project.

      <h2>Actions</h2>
      <img src="img/actions.png" alt="List of nstances of Github actions automatically building list website">
        The Actions within a Github repository refer to bots who automate processes. This automation saves labor in the process 
        of maintaining the repository. Think of the bot as a sequence of actions which can be repeated as needed, all within that 
        same sequence. When a bot carries out their actions, Github keeps a record of each time this occurs and what they did. 
    </div>
    <div class="tab">
      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <img src="img/project.png" alt="Project board showing one task to do, one task in progress, and two tasks done">
        Like the Issues tab, projects are another site of communication and organization. It allows for there to be a 
        rational visualization of information. Projects are more focused on highlighting tasks to complete than 
        facilitating discussion, but Issues and Pull Requests can be linked within tasks.
    </div>
    <div class="tab">
      <h2>Wiki</h2>
      <img src="img/wiki.png" alt="An example of a Wiki page with a short introduction">
        This tab serves as a center for information communication and documentation. Like the README, 
        the Wiki might be considered a psuedo-fining aid and user guide for accessing and interacting with 
        the collections in the repository. 
    </div>
    <div class="tab">
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <img src="img/security.png" alt="List Security options for the repo such as a security policy setup center.">
        This is where it is possible to see how this project is taking steps to protect the privacy of 
        users as they interact with the software. On pandas, this serves as a site to report security risks 
        users find.

    </div>
    <div class="tab">
      <h2>Insights</h2>
      <img src="img/insights.png" alt="Visualization created to show contribution to the repository">
        Insights is a tab collected by Github itself, visualizing information about the project community. This is where 
        Github as a platform surfaces individual contributions to the project and evaluates the community 
        according to a set of standards based on Github best practices, holding the community accountable to these.
