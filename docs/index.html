      <h1>Github as a Library</h1>
      <h2>Shell Library of Repositories</h2>
      In Github, each project is held within a repository. Github as a whole can be considered a shell library, where each repository is within but unattached to the whole library. 
      Each project operates as its own entity.
      <h2>Collections in Repositories</h2> 
      Within each repository is a file structure, which represent their collections. A collection is represented by a folder, which might include cod files or documentation.
