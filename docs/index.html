      <h1>Github as a Library</h1>
      <h2>Shell Library of Repositories</h2>
      In Github, each project is held within a repository. Github as a whole can be considered a shell library, where each repository is within but unattached to the whole library. 
      Each project operates as its own entity.
      <h2>Collections in Repositories</h2> 
      Within each repository is a file structure, which represent their collections. A collection is represented by a folder, which might include cod files or documentation. 
      The natural order is determined by the users and recorded automatically by the Git and Github system. 
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>Repository Overview</h1>
        The structure of the repository given by Github presents a rational approach to organization of infromation, organized 
        by tabs. We will explore the repository through each tab. 
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>Code Tab</h1>
      The Code Tab is located on the front page of the repository.
      <h2>Commits</h2>
      Above the file structure are the commits for the repository. These represent when information is checked in or out of the repository. 
      Commits one of the methods Github uses to record the versions of the information within. 
      The check out process begins with cloning the repository with the command
      <p>git clone repository_link</p>
      Then, your version of the reposutory can be updated with command
      <p>"git pull"</p>

      There are two methods for accessioning information or aquiring new versions of items. One of these is via commits, which follow this process:
      <p>
        1. git add -A
        2. git commit -m "your commit message"
        3. git push
      </p>

      When items or new versions of items are checked in, they are mirrored in the online collection in Github as they have been placed in the folders on the user's computer. Now, 
      users can check out the most updated version of the repository. 

      Other methods of aquisition will be covered later. 
      <h2>Branches</h2>
        When a repository is being used according to the best practices in software which value discrete levels of organization, 
        branches are used. Like within library systems, information circulates between branches and some branches might contain 
        information others do not. Additionally, the main branch is considered the one with the most information and resources. 
        This is the same with branches on Github. Contributors can create branches, check in new information, and request tthat 
        information to be shared into the main branch.

      <h2>README</h2>
      Consider the README as a psuedo-finding aid or carrying out the actions of a reference librarian. The README, located below the collections, holds essential information about the project and repository, and directs users toward important 
      information such as details about the project, how to begin using the software, and how to contribute in the free open source software (FOSS) community. 

      The structure of READMEs varies by project, but they tend to share this same purpose. Other READMEs which deviate from this might hold a collection of information on a specific 
      topic within the README itself. This is an example of how Github is flexible to the intentions of users of the platform. 
      <h2>Releases and Packages</h2>
        Releases and packages are a more formal method of recording the version of information. When a release of a document is made 
        or a package of software is released. Every release is preserved as new ones come out, and can still be accessed as 
        new versions are made. Because Github software tends to revolve around the work of FOSS communities, each release of 
        software is the version of a cultural record of these communities.
