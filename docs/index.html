      <h1>Github as a Library</h1>
      <h2>Shell Library of Repositories</h2>
      In Github, each project is held within a repository. Github as a whole can be considered a shell library, where each repository is within but unattached to the whole library. 
      Each project operates as its own entity.
      <h2>Collections in Repositories</h2> 
      Within each repository is a file structure, which represent their collections. A collection is represented by a folder, which might include cod files or documentation. 
      The natural order is determined by the users and recorded automatically by the Git and Github system.

      <h1>Code Tab</h1>
      The Code Tab is located on the front page of the repository.
      <h2>Commits</h2>
      Above the file structure are the commits for the repository. These represent when information is checked in or out of the repository. 
      The check out process begins with cloning the repository with the command "git clone repository_link". 
      Then, your version of the reposutory can be updated with the command "git pull".

      There are two methods for accessioning information to the collections. One of these is via commits, which follow this process
      1. git add -A
      2. git commit -m "your commit message"
      3. git push

      When items are accessioned, they are mirrored in the online collection in Github as they have been placed in the folders on the user's computer.
      <h2>README</h2>
      Consider the README as a psuedo-finding aid. The README, located below the collections, hold essential information about the project and direct users
