      <h1>Annotated Bibliography</h1>
      <div class = "intro">
        This annotated bibliography includes the sources from the <a href="https://johnsc1.github.io/ccal-web/" class="link">Github as a Library tutorial</a>, and exists as an introduction to the Digital Humanities (DH). 
        An annotated bibliography style has been selected to situate this work in the humanities and provide a resource for learning about DH.

      <h2>Source Name </h2>

        <a href="https://janethaler.github.io/dsamtools/openrefine.html">Read Article</a>
        Above the file structure are the commits for the repository. These represent when information is checked in or out of the repository. 
        Commits one of the methods Github uses to record the versions of the information within. 
      

        The check out process begins with cloning the repository onto your computer via your terminal. A terminal is a method of communicating with your computer system by typing 
        phrases, called commands. Think of cloning as a way to download the repository, which appears as a folder with files inside. 
        The command to clone a repository is:

      <h2>Issues Tab</h2>
        <div class="text">
          Issues are a major point of communication for free open source software development communities. Github as a platform creates 
          organization for issues, keeps record of all issues created and their order of creation by assigning ID numbers to each. This 
          allows users and contributors to continue accessing this information as they work with the project.

      <h2>Pull Requests Tab</h2>
        <div class="text">
          Pull requests are another way of accessioning or aquiring new information to the repository and collections. They take a piece of the project 
          which has been continuously modified seperate from the main branch and add this set of modifications to the main branch. A pull request contains 
          commits, which are collected within a branch or fork. 

          In order for the information in these comits to be added to the main branch, maintainers of 
          the repository must accept the pull request and facilitate the merging of commits 
          into the main branch.

      <h2>Actions</h2>
      
        <div class="text">
          The Actions within a Github repository refer to bots who automate processes. This automation saves labor in the process 
          of maintaining the repository. Think of the bot as a sequence of actions which can be repeated as needed, all within that 
          same sequence. When a bot carries out their actions, Github keeps a record of each time this occurs and what they did.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
     
        <div class="text">
          Like the Issues tab, projects are another site of communication and organization. It allows for there to be a 
          rational visualization of information. Projects are more focused on highlighting tasks to complete than 
          facilitating discussion, but Issues and Pull Requests can be linked within tasks.

      <h2>Wiki</h2>
      
        <div class="text">
          This tab serves as a center for information communication and documentation. Like the README, 
          the Wiki might be considered a psuedo-fining aid and user guide for accessing and interacting with 
          the collections in the repository.

      <h2>Security</h2>
      
        <div class="text">
          This is where it is possible to see how this project is taking steps to protect the privacy of 
          users as they interact with the software. On pandas, this serves as a site to report security risks 
          users find.

      <h2>Insights</h2>
      
        <div class="text">
          Insights is a tab collected by Github itself, visualizing information about the project community. This is where 
          Github as a platform surfaces individual contributions to the project and evaluates the community 
          according to a set of standards based on Github best practices, holding the community accountable to these.
