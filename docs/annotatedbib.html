      <h1>Annotated Bibliography</h1>
      <div class = "intro">
        This annotated bibliography includes the sources from the <a href="https://johnsc1.github.io/ccal-web/" class="link">Github as a Library tutorial</a>, and exists as an introduction to the Digital Humanities (DH). 
        An annotated bibliography style has been selected to situate this work in the humanities and provide a resource for learning about DH.

      <h2>Source Name </h2>
      <div class="text">
        Above the file structure are the commits for the repository. These represent when information is checked in or out of the repository. 
        Commits one of the methods Github uses to record the versions of the information within. 
      

        The check out process begins with cloning the repository onto your computer via your terminal. A terminal is a method of communicating with your computer system by typing 
        phrases, called commands. Think of cloning as a way to download the repository, which appears as a folder with files inside. 
        The command to clone a repository is:

      <h2>Issues Tab</h2>
        <div class="text">
          Issues are a major point of communication for free open source software development communities. Github as a platform creates 
          organization for issues, keeps record of all issues created and their order of creation by assigning ID numbers to each. This 
          allows users and contributors to continue accessing this information as they work with the project. 
        </div>
      <h3>Open Issues</h3>
        
      
        <div class="text">
          Open issues are currently active. When they are open, users and contributors can leave comments. This helps multiple 
          individuals collaborate on one task. Contributors might seek advice from maintainers, or managers, of the project. 
          Users who recognize a problem, or bug, with the code can create issues. Sometimes issues are created to note opportunities 
          for improvement in the project. 
        </div>
      <h3>Closed Issues</h3>
      
        <div class="text">
          Closed issues are issues which have either been resolved or have gone stale (like old bread), or inactive for an extended period of time. 
          All issues are kept as closed issues once they are closed. Sometimes they are closed by maintainers because the issue has been addressed
          adequetley. Issues are most often closed due to a pull request which adds or removes information from the collections, resolving 
          the issue. These will be addressed in the following section.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="tab">
      <h2>Pull Requests Tab</h2>
        <div class="text">
          Pull requests are another way of accessioning or aquiring new information to the repository and collections. They take a piece of the project 
          which has been continuously modified seperate from the main branch and add this set of modifications to the main branch. A pull request contains 
          commits, which are collected within a branch or fork. 

          In order for the information in these comits to be added to the main branch, maintainers of 
          the repository must accept the pull request and facilitate the merging of commits 
          into the main branch.
        </div>
      

      <h3>Open Pull Requests</h3>
      
        <div class="text">
          A pull request is considered open when it has not been merge and is currently active. In an open pull request, 
          like with issues, the contributor can request a review of the pull request from the maintainers of the 
          repository. Then, if maintainers respond, they evaluate the information in the commits and use 
          the comments to communicate any necessary changes or merge approvals to the contributors. If changes are 
          requested, approval to merge into the main branch is contingent on those changes being made. 

          It is at this stage where the information to be accessioned or aquired is selected by the maintainers, 
          from what the contributors have provided. The contribution of this information and maintainers 
          reviewing this shows their service to the project itself and the project development community.
          
          Additionally, each pull request has it's own unique ID number for reference in that repository.
        </div> 

      <h3>Closed Pull Requests</h3>
      
        <div class="text">
          A closed pull request may have gone inactive, been closed without a merge, or merged into the main branch. Github itself 
          is structured to preserve these pull requests beyond their active state. These pull requests retain their unique ID, 
          and the full pull request including any discussion on it is preserved as a whole. The red icon with two disconnected pieces refers to a pull request closed without merging, 
          while a purple icon with connected pieces refers to a merged pull request closed by merging.

          Closed pull requests are valuable to the repository as they hold information which might be of use in future project developement, and 
          record the history of the communications and work in the community associated with the project.

      <h2>Actions</h2>
      
        <div class="text">
          The Actions within a Github repository refer to bots who automate processes. This automation saves labor in the process 
          of maintaining the repository. Think of the bot as a sequence of actions which can be repeated as needed, all within that 
          same sequence. When a bot carries out their actions, Github keeps a record of each time this occurs and what they did. 
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="tab">
      <h2>Projects</h2>
     
        <div class="text">
          Like the Issues tab, projects are another site of communication and organization. It allows for there to be a 
          rational visualization of information. Projects are more focused on highlighting tasks to complete than 
          facilitating discussion, but Issues and Pull Requests can be linked within tasks.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="tab">
      <h2>Wiki</h2>
      
        <div class="text">
          This tab serves as a center for information communication and documentation. Like the README, 
          the Wiki might be considered a psuedo-fining aid and user guide for accessing and interacting with 
          the collections in the repository. 
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="tab">
      <h2>Security</h2>
      
        <div class="text">
          This is where it is possible to see how this project is taking steps to protect the privacy of 
          users as they interact with the software. On pandas, this serves as a site to report security risks 
          users find.

    <div class="tab">
      <h2>Insights</h2>
      
        <div class="text">
          Insights is a tab collected by Github itself, visualizing information about the project community. This is where 
          Github as a platform surfaces individual contributions to the project and evaluates the community 
          according to a set of standards based on Github best practices, holding the community accountable to these.
