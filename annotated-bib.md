# Annotated Bibliography

For editing purposes, the annotated bibliography begins in markdown. The
annotated bibliography will be posted to the tool (website) as each part of the
bibliography is complete.

MLA citation style will be used because according to the Purdue OWL,
MLA annotated bibliographies include "a summary, an evaluation of the text,
and a reflection on its applicability to his/her own research". The justification
conclusing each citation situates the source in this project.

## OpenRefine Tutorial: 
https://janethaler.github.io/dsamtools/openrefine.html

This is a website released through Github Pages that gives an overview of
the tool OpenRefine, which supports data preprocessing without the need
for computer programming. openrefine takes in many different file types,
visualizes them as a spreadsheet, and allows the user to make edits at a
large scale, such as removing spaces from all cells. At the bottom of the webpage there are more resources linked.
The website is one static page which only scrolls up and down, beginning with some goals,
a list of materials necessary for the tutorial, and how to begin. The overall design is simple, with good contrast and many screenshots of tool use to guide the user. The tutorial walks the user through faceting first, then other possible actions. It somewhat builds on each piece, but each action could be done seperately.
This website is applicable to this project because OpenRefine is geared toward humanities researchers and does not require
coding bacground to use.

## Get Started (from pytest docs):
https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/getting-started.html
Part of the documentation website for pytest, the Get Started page takes users through each step of setting up pytest beginning with downloading the software to how to run tests and several basic commands for working with the tool in the command line interface. The tutorial briefly explains what happens at each step through brief writing, as well as code comments and command line interface (CLI) commands. These can be copied and run on the user's local machine as they complete the tutorial. At the bottom of the page, some related tips for pytest are linked.
Because this tutorial is geared toward users who have programming experience, it is standard for there to be code blocks seperate from the rest of the words on the website, where this code and CLI commands can be copied for the user to learn how to operate the tool. There is also output shown in the code blocks after some commands, as it would appear when the user is implementing the tool. This design is geared toward individuals with programming experience. Having each piece of the tutorial build upon itself or be closely related to the last helps users familiarize themselves with the tool as they add depth to their knowledge.
This website is applicable because pytest is a well-established open source project on Github, similiar to pandas where the CCAL was initially applied. To understand how users are intrduced to a programming tool, in addition to non-programming ones, help inform design choices to familiarize users new to programming/Github with how this functions without overwhelming them in the learning process.

## ArchivesSpace website and video references

ArchivesSpace is an open source tool which helps support
digital archives. The repository where the tool is maintained is Github, and there have been multiple releases since 2013 including the current release. There is a website associated with the tool, and although there is not a single clear tutorial for the tool, there are many associated videos for matienence and a "Help Center" that is available for members. Membership in their community is a way of financially supporting their work, which is a limitation often encountered in open source work.
Although there is not one single tutorial space, there are tutorials for starting the tool, modifying it, youtube videos as documentation, and "Help Center" for members. The focus will be on these youtube videos. There are two videos which function as documentation, one specifically being labelled a reference. Having youtube videos as documentation suggests that interactivity seems to be important to this community of archivists in how they learn about software.

This video and these websites have been included because they inform tutorial elements which may be important to archivists, which are some of the target users of the CCAL tutorial. The use of youtube tutorials in ArchivesSpace suggests that interactivity will be an important to factor into the tutorial, such as through Javascript.

## We Go Together: Situating Github in Library Science
https://github.com/johnsc1/we-go-together/blob/main/SeniorThesis.pdf

This article researches how core values from Gorman's Core Values for Libraries and actions of librarians and the SAA core values for archivists apply to Github repositories. This application is done through detaild discussion of their application through each tab of the code repository in terms of the functionality of Github itself. 

The CCAL website project is based off this article, with the goal of providing a more practical introduction to these concepts. The CCAL website moves away from intense scholarly discussion and toward a more accessible format for learning this method of approaching a Github repository.

# Summary of Considerations 

The annotated bibliography surfaces some important considerations for the design and 
user experience of the CCAL website. 

```
Notes for further work
Look for huamnities tools on github for another tutorial
Look up scaffolding in education paper or two
