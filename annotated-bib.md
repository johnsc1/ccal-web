# Annotated Bibliography

For editing purposes, the annotated bibliography begins in markdown. The
annotated bibliography will be posted to the tool (website) as each part of the
bibliography is complete.

MLA citation style will be used because according to the Purdue OWL,
MLA annotated bibliographies include "a summary, an evaluation of the text,
and a reflection on its applicability to his/her own research". The justification
conclusing each citation situates the source in this project.

OpenRefine Tutorial: https://janethaler.github.io/dsamtools/openrefine.html
This is a website released through Github Pages that gives an overview of
the tool OpenRefine, which supports data preprocessing without the need
for computer programming. openrefine takes in many different file types,
visualizes them as a spreadsheet, and allows the user to make edits at a
large scale, such as removing spaces from all cells.
The website is one static page which only scrolls up and down, beginning with some goals,
a list of materials necessary for the tutorial, and how to begin. The overall design is simple, with good contrast and many screenshots of tool use to guide the user. The tutorial walks the user through faceting first, then other possible actions. It somewhat builds on each piece, but each action could be done seperately.
This website is applicable to this project because OpenRefine is geared toward humanities researchers and does not require
coding bacground to use.
