# Iteration 4 

My thesis for this course has been building a tutorial website motivated by user experience. 
I concluded the third iteration with the thesis being supported by the annotated bibliography, 
but lacking in user feedback to understand the efficacy of the tutorial and in some elements of design (readable format, screenshots). For the fourth iteration I began with adding screenshots for many more parts of the tutorial (at least one for each section of the repository on Github) and starting some formatting. Part of this was finishing developing an 
example repository, which I created to take screenshots of simple interactions with Github to use in the tutorial. This was opposed to using an existing project repository, such as pandas, because the screenshots may have included technical terms unknown to someone outside of software. This example repository is referenced at the end of the tutorial as a resource fo users to read through for further understanding. Something often used in software is a "sandbox" project which allows users to experiment with a tool without breaking any important code. To give users space to experiment with the tutorial methods without disrupting the example repository, I created a sandbox repository for interactive learning. 

After the remaining screenshots were added to the tutorial, I asked for feedback on the tutorial content and design from a friend of mine in the MLIS program who has worked in libraries. They emphasized the importance of the screenshots in understanding the content, 
and made suggestions on further refining the formatting of the page. This feedback was vital 
to understanding the importance of the thesis and directed my focus more toward refining the 
website css formatting for much of this iteration. 

### 1. What was your process for this course? What did your Mindful Practice Journal show you about your process over the entire term? Please summarize what you have written and draw conclusions from your experience. 

In the earlier iterations, espceially the first and second, I would go into the iteration with a long list of goals, become overwhelmed by them, and struggle to begin working on any. This 
led to procrastinating on beginning, which would only increase the overwhelm. At times this was
complicated by my own failure to set clear time boundaries with group work in my other courses, and allowing myself to use time I set aside specifically for this project toward 
another course. After I made that decision, I felt discouraged with myself for not making 
progress on this course. My website was nowhere near as developed as I knew it could be. 
I was not satisfied with the outcome of this process, and after feeling very unsatisfid with the lack of movement in my project in the second iteration I began to change this approach. 

Over the course of the rest of the semester, I moved toward having less severe expectations and just beginning with one task, then not looking beyond that 
until I have completed some degree of work toward that goal. Oftentimes, this would be working 
on formatting the website. My mindful practice journal showed that once I made some progress 
on something, I felt more focused on completing more tasks in the project. At that point, I 
would jump around between working on different parts of the project with much little difficulty starting the tasks. I think this change in process worked much better with the 
iterations of the course, and I felt the structure of the iterations allowed me to release my perfectionism about my work and focus on doing the work. 

### 2. What did this course demonstrate to you? What were the joys and the frustrations? Did you succeed in learning what you came here to learn? Why or why not? What things did you learn that you did not expect to learn? 

This course demonstrated to me a different view of technical systems which I have been seeking since I started programming as an undergrad. I have been seeking an environment where I am 
able to both work with the technical systems I enjoy working with and also learn to understand them beyond that, espceially with regards to their consequinces, and I feel I have succeeded in developing that understanding in this course through our readings and seminar discussions.  

This was not an easy process, and I still found and find myself being more 
focused on efficiency and less on the process itself. I did feel frustrated when I was resorting back to an efficiency mindset in my work and beng focused on major goals instead of a process. Breaking away from that mindset I developed in undergrad was frustrating in the moment, but I feel joy in having a new approach now. 

### 3. How did the term-long feedback process affect your work? 

At the conclusion of each iteration, before beginning to work on the next, I would take 
in the feedback and decide where I would begin working for the next iteration. I allowed the feedback to guide the direction of my work and help ground each beginning of an iteration since I sometimes struggled with where to begin. Coming from computer science, I still have the tendancy to focus more than necessary on tecnical development, which would lead to me not considering the users. I found the long-term feedback continuously helped me return to considering users and refining my idea of the user of this tutorial. 

### Concluding this Project

Right now the tutorial website is in a good place, though there is room for developing the design of the website. The annotated bibliography could benefit from further work before the final deadline.
