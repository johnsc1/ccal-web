#### Iteration 2 Questions 

1. What was your process for this iteration? What did your Mindful Practice Journal show  you about that process? Please summarize your journal notes and draw conclusions from your experience.  

My process for the second iteration was the itention of working on the iteration for short 2 hour chunks a few times a week. However, 
this did not occur in practice, as this time was repeatedly taken by meetings in another class which ran severely overtime. After a week of that, I was disatisfied with the state of my project, and spent a few days reevaluating my priorities. The result was setting firm time boundaries this week with the other course to preserve work time for this class. I still am not satisfied with the results of this iteration, and am alotting additional time in my schedule to get the website to a more satisfactory state with a skeleton of a tutorial design and CSS design implemented, in addition to the third iteration process. 


2. What have you learned about your question? What have you learned about your  captaset? What have you learned about your digital tools?  

For my question, I have learned more about how to design the website to best fit users. This has shown that the website navigation should be simple and clear, while allowing for interactivity with users, such as through audio or visual media. Bullet points to list out information may also be helpful. 

This iteration I focused more on tutorials and understanding what their intended users are. There are clear deisgn and communication differences programming tool and non-coding tool tutorials, and the addition to ArchiveSpace shows the importance of interactivity with the tutorial itself rather than just with the tool. 

With starting the website, I have considered that programming the entire website from scratch may not be compatible with time limitations. Although there are design limitations to using html templates, they can be modified to some extent and 
will allow for more time focused on developing the tutorial method than building the website itself.

3. What feedback have your peers and instructors given you so far, and how have you taken it into consideration? 

An important piece of feedback from the instructor has been advising to determine the intended user of this 
tutorial website. The intended user for the idea as a whole was originally anyone who is entering computer science 
without programming background, especially if they are coming from a humanities background. In the thesis document, 
this was considered in terms of computer science students in introductory undergraduate courses. Because of the enourmosity of 
Github repositories as a whole and the challengings in simplifying that, the intended users of the tutorial at this stage should be 
individuals with archives or library background who are learning to use Github. 

I am also considering the users of tutorials I am citing and scaffolding tutorial design as recommeneded by my peers.
