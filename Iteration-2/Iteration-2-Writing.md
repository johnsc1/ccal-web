#### Iteration 2 Questions 

1. What was your process for this iteration? What did your Mindful Practice Journal show  you about that process? Please summarize your journal notes and draw conclusions from your experience.  



2. What have you learned about your question? What have you learned about your  captaset? What have you learned about your digital tools?  

3. What feedback have your peers and instructors given you so far, and how have you taken it into consideration? 

An important piece of feedback from the instructor has been advising to determine the intended user of this 
tutorial website. The intended user for the idea as a whole was originally anyone who is entering computer science 
without programming background, especially if they are coming from a humanities background. In the thesis document, 
this was considered in terms of computer science students in introductory undergraduate courses. Because of the enourmosity of 
Github repositories as a whole and the challengings in simplifying that, the intended users of the tutorial at this stage should be 
individuals with archives or library background who are learning to use Github. S
