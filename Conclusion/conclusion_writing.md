This project exists in the space between LIS and Computer Science, and
between two different approaches to the technical side of
information systems. The professions within Computer Science value efficiency
and have systems with standardized processes which handle information storage and project collaboration complete the action of this value. This mode of work differs in LIS, where process can differ by the individual
and the focus their work often centers around process, such as making preservation decisions, rather than automating those processes.

Working with information systems has become a common task in LIS
with the advancement of technology. Most LIS program cirriculum has been updated
to include learning how to code and work with database systems. However,
computer science education, in my experience with my peers, failed to be
understood as approachable by many students outside the discipline. This
seems to be due to the presentation of these systems being limited to technical
details, with no contextual vehicle to support their communication. To a computer
scientist, these systems ar vital, but this view is not necessarily shared with LIS professionals
whose work is increasingly moving digital. Learning these systems can be of value to LIS when one considers how
LIS is already situated to support educating their community through a library, and the value to their patrons
to be able to understand technical systems. Developing a greater knowledge of these systems helps
remove users from the idea that these systems are "magic" and allows them to more accurately weigh
on their own accord the affordances and risks of software.

This tutorial website attempts to communicate the functionality of Github,
a massive database of software, within the context of digital LIS work. It
attempts to communicate these systems to an appropriate technical degree for
a beginning user.
