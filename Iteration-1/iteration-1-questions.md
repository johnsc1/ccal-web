# Iteration 1 Questions
Captaset is located under the captaset folder.

#### 1. What is your hypothesis, thesis, or engaging line of inquiry that you would like to  investigate during this course?

I would like to investigate how to teach the meanings behind Github best practice uses and the functions of a Github repository as an archive through illutsrating a practical application of this methodology, beyond a written discussion of this. This methodology was named the CCAL (Community Code Archival Librarianship).  

This is an expansion of my undergraduate thesis [link doi], motivated by questions from thesis advisors about how this methodology could be applied in teaching about Github.

Although this is not the center of the investigation, I am hoping to develop a new and more condensed name for the CCAL, because this will aid in communicating the methodology more clearly. 

* Why do you think your question would be well-served by the application of digital tools?

Digital tools are helpful for visualizing data, which can be used to communicate information in a way other than written discussion. At this time, the CCAL method is defined through several pages of scholarly writing, which may not be accessible to all users of the method, espceially if they would like to develop this understanding but are coming from a background outstide the disciplines of Computer Science and Library and Information Science. 

* What benefits do you anticipate that your exploration of the captaset will draw from the use of such tools?

A benefit from using these tools will be wider accessibility of the CCAL method. Rathar than needing to read through several pages of writing to develop an understanding of the CCAL, users may elect to begin with a tool which shows them directly how this method can be applied. Users may not need as much prior background in the disciplines to begin understanding how the CCAL method is applied. Having a visualization may positively influence the learning of the users when they do read through the written CCAL application process, as there is now a vsualization of the full process rather than just screenshots to support an arguement. 

* Which type(s) of digital tools do you think will best serve it and why?

Becuase of the importance for users to be able to access this project, a website would be most likely to best serve the captaset. This is because the wbesite is searchable from Google, and therefore requires less background knowledge of using database software and Github

Because the purpose of the project is to visualize the process and design this website around it, a website is a likely candidate due to the customization opportunities. The webiste can have interactive components for the CCAL method or pictures, and the website can also hold the annotated bibliography, Both of these are able to be stored in one place. 

Because the captaset includes the CCAL method itself and Computer Science as a discipline is of importance to this work, Github has been chosen to hold the captaset, questions, and bibliography sources while the website is in progress, This choice is motivated by knowledge of Github being industry standard in Computer Science, and as this is Computer Science research, it is valuable for those best practices to be maintained. 

#### 2. What has your Mindful Practice Journal shown you about your process thus far? Please summarize what you have written down, and go ahead and draw preliminary conclusions from your experience.

It has shown that it is important for for me to be in a space that is working for me in that moment for my focus. This is often the place with the leats amount of distractions. For some time outside home was working, but staying a home and working has been more helpful recently. I also frequently move study spaces after a few hours. I am trying to pay better attention to how my focus is working in the moment so that I can best address its shifting needs. I also struggle with beginning a task and deciding to limit the scope of the project so that I am not stuck on a specific step and can move forward.
