## Overview 

This is a WIP project for building an introductory tutorial which illustrates the practical application of Community Code Archival Librarianship, a method of approaching a Github repository, for educational purposes. The tutorial will be in the form of an interactive website, and include an annotated bibliography of supporting capta to provide an access point for research in the digital humanities. 


## CCAL Definition 

Community Code Archival Librarianship is defined as "a methodology of understanding who carries out
the actions of both a librarian and archivist in
cases involving software and FOSS communities.
This term may be used to describe the collective action of multiple individuals or entities." 

## Project Narrative 

This project originates from the article [We Go Together: Situating Github in Library Science](https://github.com/johnsc1/we-go-together/blob/main/SeniorThesis.pdf), which argues for how core values from Library Science and Archives are applicable to Github as a platform, and the 
Free Open Source Software (FOSS) project communities it supports. This discussion is the capta 
of the tutorial. Additional capta is the annotated bibliography, which has the purpose of grounding the CCAL website in user experience specific to library and information science and archives. 

#### Thesis 

At it's core, this project is a website tutorial on understanding Github, grounded in user experience specific to library and information science and archives. 

From personal experience in learning how to code and understand essential related systems such as Github, and witnessing my colleagues in undergraduate and graduate coursework learn this, beginning to understand a massive platform such as Github can be a significant learning curve. Oftentimes, computing is presented from a purely technical background, which is a perspective that may not tie into one's prior educational experience in any way. The CCAL website takes in the capta from We Go Together and uses it's existing context in LIS and archives, combined with the annotated bibliography's grounding in user experience, to attempt to use LIS context to provide an approachable, user-friendly guide to beginning to understand Github.
