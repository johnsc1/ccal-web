### **[Begin tutorial here!](https://johnsc1.github.io/ccal-web/)**

Read the Github as a Library example repository. 

Interact with this approach through the sandbox repository. 


## Overview 

This is a project for building an introductory tutorial which illustrates the practical application of Community Code Archival Librarianship, a method of approaching a Github repository, for educational purposes. The tutorial is a website, and include an annotated bibliography of supporting capta to provide an access point for research in the digital humanities. 

This project originates from the article We Go Together: Situating Github in Library Science, which argues for how core values from Library Science and Archives are applicable to Github as a platform, and the Free Open Source Software (FOSS) project communities it supports. This discussion is the capta of the tutorial. Additional capta is the annotated bibliography. 


## CCAL Definition 

Community Code Archival Librarianship is defined in *We Go Together: Situating Github in Library Science* as "a methodology of understanding who carries out
the actions of both a librarian and archivist in
cases involving software and FOSS communities.
This term may be used to describe the collective action of multiple individuals or entities."


## Project Narrative 

At it's core, this project is a website tutorial on understanding Github, grounded in user experience specific to library and information science and archives. 

From personal experience in learning how to code and understand essential related systems such as Github, and witnessing my colleagues in undergraduate and graduate coursework learn this, beginning to understand a massive platform such as Github can be a significant learning curve. Oftentimes, computing is presented from a purely technical background, which is a perspective that may not tie into one's prior educational experience in any way. The CCAL website takes in the capta from We Go Together and uses it's existing context in LIS and archives, combined with the annotated bibliography's grounding in user experience, to attempt to use LIS context to provide an approachable, user-friendly guide to beginning to understand Github. 

Working with information systems has become a common task in LIS
with the advancement of technology. Most LIS program cirriculum has been updated
to include learning how to code and work with database systems. However,
computer science education, as it seems from my experience hearing from other students, has failed to be
understood as approachable by many students outside the discipline. This
seems to be due to the presentation of these systems being limited to technical
details, with no contextual vehicle to support their communication. To a computer
scientist, these systems ar vital, but this view is not necessarily shared with LIS professionals
whose work has evolved to be more digital as the result of technical advancements. Learning how to use these systems is of value to LIS when one considers how libraries are situated to support educating their communities about technical systems their patrons encounter, and the value to their patrons
to be able to independently understand those systems. Developing a deeper knowledge of technical systems helps
remove users from the idea that these systems are "magic" and allows them to more accurately weigh on their own accord the affordances and risks of technical systems in their lives.

This tutorial website attempts to communicate the functionality of Github,
a massive database of software, within the context of digital LIS work. It
attempts to communicate these systems to an appropriate technical degree for
a beginning user. 



## Associated Resources 

#### CCAL Examples Repository

For the purpose of showing simple examples of a Github repository, the [CCAL Examples](https://github.com/johnsc1/ccal-examples) was created. Screenshots of 
this repository are used in the tutorial to provide references to actions on Github without 
including complex technical terms which a beginner user may not understand. This repository exists to be read through alongside or in addition to the tutorial. 

#### Sandbox Repository

To allow a space for interactive learning of understanding Github as a library, the [sandox repository](https://github.com/johnsc1/ccal-sandbox) was created. Sandbox repositories are commonly used in software to allow new users to experiment with the functionality of a tool before formally using it. This sandbox space protects the actual code from being broken, and in this case, preserves the examples repository for best readability. 

## Future Considerations

#### Potential Developments 

While this project was completed in a course, there is potential for future work with this 
project. Some idea are as follows: 

* adding Javascript functionality 
* imbedding GIFs or videos of use of each tab on Github into the tutorial webpage 
* creating a video walkthrough which is either imbedded in the website or links to a video platform ex. vimeo, youtube

#### Project Endings 

In accordance with recommendations on project endings, the tutorial website 
will remain in HTML/CSS, and future additions for interactivity should use 
plain Javascript instead of Javascript packages. This will support the digital 
preservation of the website, even if it is no longer maintained after a certain point. 

As of December 2022, the website and this repository remain maintained.
